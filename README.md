## Exposure_Philippis
Philippis explores the validity of the correlation of pursuing STEM degrees in higher education with the exposure to STEM done in the secondary school level. The author suggests that offering a strong science curriculum in secondary schools has no effect on university enrollment, but a it could improve educational outcomes of those individuals.  

## Education_Cuny
Cuny, a CISE program officer for the NSF (National Science Foundation) advocates for comprehensive Computer Science education programs that is centered around AP Computer Science Principles in the secondary school setting
The newly proposed curricula (new during the time this was written in 2011) would include introductory CS courses and AP Computer Science principles in an effort to integrate Computer Science into the secondary school level. 
By introducing Computer Science education at an earlier level, Cuny predicts that it will contribute to an even gender distribution in the current disproportionately male landscape of Computer Science.

Girls and Computing: Female participation in Computing Schools
Dr. Jason Zagami, Dr. Marie Boden, Dr. Therese Keane, Bronwyn Moreton, Karsten Shulz.

The authors observe literature pertaining to females in Computing, comparing low female participation with that of engineering and general STEM. The findings indicate four key influencing factors: social encouragement, self-perception, academic exposure and career perception.
In order to address these influencing factors, the authors recommend a balanced approach: engage girls in the Digital Technologies Curriculum, influence parental preconceptions and influences, provide role models and mentors and promote code clubs for girls.
